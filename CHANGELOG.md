# Changelog

All notable changes to Nexus Architect are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Version numbers refer to the per-plugin versions in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`;
all three plugins (`product`, `architect`, `scalardb`) are released together under one number.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **`product` plugin: `/product:create-domain-story` skill** — persona-anchored Domain Storytelling.
  Actors come from personas (`PER-`), activities from job stories (`JOB-`) ordered by the journey
  (`JNY-`), work items from the things handled. Each story is the chosen happy-path scenario for a
  persona pursuing a key job, scoped per persona×job (bounded contexts are optional enrichment via
  `--domain`). Runs in the UX phase, after journey/positioning and **before** UI mocks; outputs
  `reports/01_ux/domain-stories/` with `STORY-` traceability. The product-pipeline counterpart of
  `/architect:create-domain-story`.
- **`product` plugin: `/product:design-system` skill** — build or `--import` a **separately-managed**
  design system. Build derives **W3C DTCG** tokens (color/type/spacing/radius/elevation/motion) from
  positioning/personas/vision with a WCAG contrast gate; `--import` normalizes an existing system
  (Tailwind config / DTCG JSON / Figma Tokens / CSS theme) into the same schema. Output lives in a
  dedicated `design-system/<name>/` tree (not under `reports/`), carries a semver `manifest.json`,
  supports multiple coexisting named systems, and is **standalone** (runnable any time). The active
  system is recorded in `work/pipeline-progress.json` → `options.design_system`. New rule
  `rules/product/design-system.md`. **The product plugin now has 24 skills.**

### Changed
- **`/product:generate-ui-mock` is story-driven and design-system–styled** — screens are derived from
  the domain story for each persona×job (one activity ≈ one screen interaction), and styled by the
  active design system: its `tokens.css` is injected into every self-contained screen, rendered at
  `--fidelity=lo` (tokens only) or `mid` (tokens + `CMP-` component styles). Falls back to ad-hoc
  lo-fi styling when no system is configured. Screens now also trace `STORY-`/`CMP-`.
- **UX-phase ordering** — `create-domain-story` and `design-system` run after positioning and before
  `generate-ui-mock` in the `full` profile, so mocks render a chosen flow in a shared visual language.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **`product` plugin: `/product:design-architecture` skill** — synthesizes bounded contexts, API
  layers, the data model and NFRs into a runtime architecture (Mermaid container / critical-path /
  deployment-scaling views), and runs an evidence-driven **technology-fitness** assessment over a
  standing checklist — **Kong (API Gateway), ScalarDB, ScalarDB Analytics, ScalarDL** — emitting an
  Adopt / Conditional / Reject decision with rationale and architecture placement for each. A
  ScalarDB/ScalarDL *Adopt* bridges to the `architect` plugin's ScalarDB pipeline. Outputs
  `reports/03_domain/architecture.md` and `reports/03_domain/tech-stack-fitness.md`. Added to the
  `full` profile (capstone after `define-nfr`) and the dependency graph; new rule
  `rules/product/architecture-and-tech-fitness.md`. Product plugin now has 22 skills.
- **Product → architect handoff contract (`docs/design.md`)** — a single source of truth for how
  `product` output feeds the `architect` plugin, resolving previously dangling `design.md`
  references in four SKILL/rule files. Defines the artifact mapping (per-output ID prefixes →
  `define-requirements` deliverables, §1.3), the by-design gaps `product` does not supply (§1.4),
  the cross-plugin **traceability write-back** contract (`FEAT-→FR-` links, verbatim `NFR-` reuse,
  §1.5), and the canonical **adaptation-engine** spec (§7).

### Changed
- **`/architect:define-requirements` consumes product output** — auto-detects product reports under
  `reports/0*_*/`, carries product IDs forward, uses `tech-stack-fitness.md` as the ScalarDB
  applicability prior, and writes `FR-`/`NFR-` nodes back to `work/traceability.json`.
- **`/architect:start` and `/architect:pipeline` are product-aware** — run handoff detection up
  front and route to the greenfield path with product reports fed in.
- **`/product:map-domains`** now emits a coarse per-`CTX-` consistency hint (`Strong`/`Eventual`/
  `TBD`) that seeds architect's transaction-consistency classification.
- **`/architect:review-consistency`** checks cross-plugin traceability continuity.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Bumped all three plugin versions to 0.8.2.

### Documentation
- Documented the `create-domain-story` (Design) and `review-report` (Reporting) skills
  in `README.md` and the skill reference (en/ja), which previously listed 41 of the 43
  architect skills.
- Corrected the `/architect:pipeline` flag reference
  (`--resume-from`, `--rerun-from`, `--skip-{phase}`, `--no-scalardb`, `--lang`).
- Surfaced the `product` plugin in the Getting Started and Codex usage guides (en/ja):
  added a "Product Direction (greenfield)" entry point, the `/product:*` skill mapping
  (`skills/product/<name>/SKILL.md`), and the product install command.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- Fixed a plugin namespace collision that prevented `product:` and `scalardb:` namespaced
  skills from loading. Skills are now scoped per plugin via explicit `skills[]` arrays in
  the marketplace manifest, so each plugin registers only its own commands.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **`product` plugin** (21 skills, 14 rules) — a validation-driven, dialogue-based product
  direction pipeline from product vision to SLA/NFR. Extracts and validates the riskiest
  assumptions before deep design, propagates changes through a traceability graph, and hands
  off to `/architect:define-requirements` for system implementation design.

Nexus Architect is now a three-plugin toolkit (`product`, `architect`, `scalardb`)
with 75 skills total.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- `/architect:define-requirements` skill as the greenfield entry point: functional/
  non-functional requirement classification, data and transaction requirement analysis,
  and ScalarDB applicability assessment. Supports `--input`, `--auto`, and `--no-scalardb`.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- `/architect:create-domain-story` skill for Domain Storytelling (visualize business
  processes per domain).
- `/architect:review-report` skill to review the quality of the generated HTML report.
- `ec-monolith` sample project for toolkit validation.

### Fixed
- Resolved agent component audit findings across hooks, skills, and manifests.
- Repaired Mermaid validator block parsing and added a ubiquitous-language term alignment rule.
- Added calculation procedures and self-verification to the `investigate` skill.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Parallel sub-agent execution in the review and evaluation skills.
- Parallelized `migrate-oracle` SA3/SA4/SA5 stages after the schema report.

### Fixed
- Multi-perspective review fixes across 28 files.
- Corrected skill invocations and nested sub-skill paths across the migration pipeline.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Codex compatibility layer (`AGENTS.md`): the same skill files are usable from Codex
  without installing Claude Code plugins.

### Fixed
- Removed the `name` field from all SKILL.md files to enable `/architect:` prefix registration.
- Resolved skill audit findings (manifest naming, frontmatter, JDBC patterns).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Split the ScalarDB development skills into a separate `scalardb` plugin.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Database migration support (Oracle / MySQL / PostgreSQL → ScalarDB): schema extraction,
  migration analysis, and stored-procedure/trigger conversion to Java.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- ScalarDB application development skills (schema modeling, configuration, CRUD/JDBC patterns,
  scaffolding, code review, migration advisory).

## [0.2.0]

### Changed
- Restructured the repository into a Claude Code plugin-compatible layout.
